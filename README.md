# Phishing-url-detection
This repository contains the code and data for a project focused on detecting phishing URLs using various machine learning techniques. The project aims to analyze and differentiate between legitimate and phishing URLs based on their characteristics, helping to enhance cybersecurity measures.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Methods to preprocess datasets containing both legitimate and phishing URLs.
- **Feature Extraction**: Techniques to extract relevant features from URLs, including the number of special characters, the presence of specific keywords, and more.
- **Visualization**: Scripts to generate visualizations, such as word clouds and box plots, to analyze common patterns in URLs.
- **Model Training**: Implementation of various machine learning algorithms to classify URLs as legitimate or phishing.
- **Evaluation**: Metrics and evaluation techniques to assess the performance of the models.
- **Deployment**: Example code to deploy the model for real-time phishing URL detection.
